<!-- Pitch -->

Are you interested in single-page application architecture?
Having trouble or aren't sure where to start?
Using Django, Vue.js—a popular front-end application framework—and a few supporting tools,
we'll go from zero to the beginnings of a social networking application covering some common patterns.

# Views and Vues: single-page applications with Django and Vue.js

This tutorial will start from absolute zero
and end up with an application attendees can take back with them
and build off of or use as an example for building their own applications.

## Outline

### Setup

We'll install all our dependencies
and make sure our environment is looking right.

#### Installing Django and supporting tools

* Install Django
* Install django-rest-framework
* Install django-webpack-loader

#### Installing Vue and supporting tools

* Install Vue
* Install webpack
* Install webpack loaders
* Install babel

### Getting started

We'll make sure Django is running well
and get a bare Vue application going.

#### Hello Django

* Make sure the server displays the "install worked successfully!" page
* Create a route for our application that returns a basic HTML skeleton

#### Hello Vue

* Create an `App.vue` component and get it building in webpack
* Hook the app to our HTML page

### Building up the backend

#### Creating our Django models

* Create models for user profiles
* Create models for user relationships
* Create models for user interaction

#### Creating our API

* Create API endpoints for creating and retrieving user data

### Building up the frontend

* Create pages for profiles and timelines
* Create, fetch, and display data from our API endpoints

### Conclusion

* Recap
* Considerations for performance and testing
* Where do we go from here?

<!-- Notes -->

I've been developing with Django both personally and professionally for about five years.
I've also developed for frontend applications most of that time,
and I'm currently learning Vue.js.
I think the pairing of Django and Vue.js (or any reactive frontend framework) is particularly intriguing and practical
for web development at the moment,
so I imagine others will be keen on the idea.

Nota bene: I've been developing on macOS for quite some time now,
and my ability to debug issues on Windows (or the Linux subsystem) is likely to be impacted by this.
